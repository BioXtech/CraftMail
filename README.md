# CraftMail
CraftMail is a reproduction of the mail system irl for in Minecraft use.
CraftMail is entirely within Minecraft, there is no connection with the Internet..
It is composed of two parts: a client and a server.
Yoiu need to seperates computers to make it work.

## Client
The CraftMail client is divided in three parts:
- Sending mail part
- Inbox part
- Address book part

To send an email to a recipient, you just need to put his ID in the text field supposed for this.
Then you type your text and you press enter.(Multiline text is not supported for this moment but it will come one day :smiley: )

The inbox part gather email from the server then print the 10 newer of them.

The address book is just there for you to remember the IDs of the people you want to text to. 

The overall of the UI is not that good looking but I'm workin on it :smiley: .


## Server

The server prints its network activity on the screen and do what a server needs to do.
